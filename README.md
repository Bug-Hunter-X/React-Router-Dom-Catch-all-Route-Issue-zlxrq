# React Router Dom Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router Dom v6 with the catch-all route (`/*`).  The catch-all route appears to always match, even when another route should take precedence.

The issue is described in the `App.js` file, and the solution in `AppSolution.js` demonstrates a workaround.
